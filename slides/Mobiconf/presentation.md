# Framework Oriented Programming

## Context
## _How_
## Tips
## _Downsides_

![70%](images/box.png)

^ I would like to start this talk with a very simple question.
^ How many of you know what that thing is?

---

# _Box_
^ The answer is as simple as the question.
^ It's a box

---

## _Things with something_
## in common

^ We use boxes in our lives to collect/save things that have something in common.

---

# üíåüì∑üóí

^ Some examples of these things could be love letters, photos, diaries, notes.

---

![image](images/developer.jpeg)

^ However we're developers, we don't work with these sort of things.
^ You don't code love letters, or save photos in code.

---

![inline, 50%](images/h_file.png)![inline, 50%](images/m_file.png)![inline, 50%](images/swift_file.png)

^ In a daily basis we work with source code.
^ Headers, body files, Swift files.
^ Any kind of file that represents business logic written in any language.

---

## ~~Boxes~~
## _Frameworks_

^ Our boxes, where we save the source code and things that have something in common are Frameworks.

---

![inline, 60%](images/framework.png)

In computer science, a framework is a _collection_ of implementations of _behavior_, written in terms of a _language_, that has a _well-defined interface_ by which the behavior is invoked
__Wikipedia__

---

# External
# _Frameworks_

^ We usually use them from external sources.
^ We use tools, known as dependency managers that are responsible of resolving the dependencies tree and provide you with these framework that you can link from your app.

---

![fill](images/external_frameworks.png)

^ Rubygems and NPM are two examples of dependency managers for the Ruby and the Javascript community.
^ If you're a Cocoa developer the most used dependency tools in the community are CocoaPods and Carthage.

---

```ruby
inhibit_all_warnings!
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
  pod "PureLayout"
  pod 'FLEX'
  pod 'DateTools'
  pod 'Reachability'
  pod 'RxSwift'
  pod 'SDWebImage'
  pod "SDVersion"
  pod 'BlocksKit'
  pod 'CTFeedback'
  pod 'TOWebViewController'
  pod '1PasswordExtension'
  pod 'SlackTextViewController'
  pod 'FeedbackMe'
  pod 'Localize-Swift'
  pod 'Smooch'
  pod 'Fabric'
  pod 'Crashlytics'
  pod 'CWStatusBarNotification'
  pod "ImagePickerSheetController"
  pod 'KYNavigationProgress'
end
```

^ This is an example of a Podfile where we specify all the external dependencies that we want to link our app against to.

---

### :apple:
## _1 app target_
### +
## X External frameworks

^ Most of projects nowadays are based on one target with multiple external dependencies.

---

## _Simple_
## _projects_
![50%](images/xcode_icon.png)

^ Pet projects
^ Few source files
^ Extensive use of external dependencies

---

## _Small_ teams
### __(and not distributed)__<br><br>

^ Less than 10 people.
^ Working in a monolithic project.
^ Working in the project is a pleasure.

---

## Only _1-2 platforms_<br><br>
# üñ• :iphone:

^ Few years ago, few platforms

---

# :apple:

^ Big change in the market from Apple
^ Introduced new members to the family.

---

## _New_ platforms <br><br>
## üñ•üì±‚åöÔ∏èüì∫

^ Currently 4 platforms
^ More coming

## Couldn't
## _reuse code_
## _scale easily_

^ Pain in the ass
^ Copying files between targets didn't scale.

---

## Bigger projects
## _Bigger teams_
### __(and also distributed)__

^ SoundCloud is distributed

---

# _Conflicts_
## Between teams
### __(Interdependencies)__

## _Framework Oriented Programming_
![image](images/mountain.jpeg)

---

## __Architectural Approach__<br>

### Modularizing your apps code bases in _local_ and _multiplatform_ frameworks that expose a _hookable_ interface.

---

### New platforms/targets
# _Gluing_

---

![fill](images/frameworks_ui.png)

---

# _Atomic teams_
## that own frameworks

---

![fill](images/teams_frameworks.png)

---

### Decide about _persistence_
### Decide about _patterns_
### Decide about _architecture_
### Decide about _language_

---

### Framework
## Exposes an _API_

---

![fill](images/frameworks_api.png)

---

### Fewer _interdependencies_
### Fewer _conflicts_
### Fewer _bugs_

## _How to_
### _Setup the project_

![image](images/coast.jpeg)

---

## Using CocoaPods

#### _Create pods_
#### _Link the project against them_

---

```bash
mkdir Frameworks; cd Frameworks;
pod lib create Core
pod lib create UI
pod lib create Player
pod lib create Offline
```

---

```ruby
Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name = 'Player'
  s.dependency 'Core'
  s.dependency 'UI'
end
```

---

```ruby
abstract_target 'Frameworks' do
  pod "Core", :path => "Frameworks/Core"
  pod "UI", :path => "Frameworks/UI"
  pod "Player", :path => "Frameworks/Player"
  pod "Offline", :path => "Frameworks/Offline"

  # Platforms
  target "MyApp"
  target "MyTVApp"
  target "MyWatchApp"
end
```

---

## _Manually_
### Creating/Linking

---

## _Workspace_
### Multiple framework projects
#### Linked/Embedded

## Multi-Platform Framework

```bash
# Supported platforms
SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = iphoneos iphonesimulator appletvsimulator appletvos macosx watchsimulator watchos

# Valid architectures
VALID_ARCHS[sdk=macosx*] = x86_64
VALID_ARCHS[sdk=iphone*] = arm64 armv7 armv7s

# Frameworks Search Path
LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS[sdk=iphone*] = $(inherited) @executable_path/Frameworks @loader_path/Frameworks
LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS[sdk=macosx*] = $(inherited) @executable_path/../Frameworks @loader_path/../Frameworks
LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS[sdk=watch*]   = $(inherited) @executable_path/Frameworks @loader_path/Frameworks
LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS[sdk=appletv*] = $(inherited) @executable_path/Frameworks @loader_path/Frameworks
```

---

## _Tips_
![image](images/dj.jpeg)

---

## _Minimize_
### External dependencies
#### __(Do it by yourself)__

---

### How frameworks are _linked_?
### Should a framework be _embedded_?
### Can I link it _statically_?

---

## _Analyze_
### Existing tools __(e.g. CocoaPods)__

---

![fit](images/cocoapods_1.png)

---

![fit](images/cocoapods_2.png)

---

## _Find the setup_
### that works for you

---

## Freelance

![inline](images/setup_freelance.png)

---

## Feature Teams

![inline](images/setup_teams.png)

---

## Multi-Platform apps

![inline](images/setup_platforms.png)

---

## Define a public contract
### _and communication patterns_
^For example if it's objective-c, interfaces should be Objective-C compatible.

---

# Internal
## _by default_

---

## Monorepo
### _Unified versioning_

^Keep all the frameworks in the same repository.
^Version only if there's another project reusing the framework.

---

## _Downsides_

![fill](images/water.jpeg)

---

## _Documentation_
### Not good enough

---

## _No homogeneity_
# APIs

---

# Macros

```swift
#if !os(macOS)
  import AppKit
  typealias Image = NSImage
#else
  import UIKit
  typealias Image = UIImage
#end
```

---

# _Xcode_
## Has a long way to go
### üôè :apple:

^ Error forwarding
^ Frameworks recompilation

---

# _Conclussions_

- Fewer conflicts in big teams.
- Easy multiplatfom apps.
- Aims good practices (API).

## Do it if _only_ if your _project needs it_
