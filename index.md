## :warning: Work in progress :warning:
We're migrating the existing reference on the repository [pepibumur/framework-oriented-programming](https://github.com/pepibumur/framework-oriented-programming) to its own website. Stay tuned!.

# Migration
> The purpose of this section is explaining the best approach for transitioning from a existing monolithic project to a frameworks setup.

# Setups
Would you like to know which setup is best according to your project/team structure? Start by answering the following questions:

## Freelance setup

### Need 
Freelancers tend to repeat code across projects. That doesn't make sense, does it? A frameworks setup would help you to save time. 

### How
Just create a *FreelanceKit/StudioKit/MyNameKit* with the components that you usually repeat in projects *(e.g. database tooling, api tooling...)*.

## Feature teams setup
Nothing in this section yet

# Contribute

## How to contribute?

Feel free to improve the reference. Check out the repository, follow the setup steps and make your proposals. Create a PR with your proposal and we'll discuss the proposal before merging it. Make sure that CI is passing and the website/projects compile accordingly.

**We're looking forward to your improvements!**
